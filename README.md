[SAP S/4HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html) is a robust enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution,
designed for large-scale enterprises by SAP SE. It covers core business processes such as finance, procurement, sales,
and materials management, including sourcing and procurement.

This repository encompasses all Ballerina packages pertaining to the SAP S/4HANA Sourcing & Procurement module.
Notably:

1. [SAP S/4HANA Purchasing Info Record](ballerina/api_inforecord_process_srv) provides a way to interact with the
   [Purchasing Info Record API](https://api.sap.com/api/API_INFORECORD_PROCESS_SRV/overview).
   The service allows to create, read, update and delete purchasing info records, with their purchasing organization
   and plant data, purchase order texts and pricing conditions.

## Build from the source

### Prerequisites

1. Download and install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 17. You can download it from either of the following
   sources:

   * [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
   * [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/)

   > **Note:** After installation, remember to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the directory where JDK was
   installed.

2. Download and install [Ballerina Swan Lake](https://ballerina.io/).

3. Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

   > **Note**: Ensure that the Docker daemon is running before executing any tests.

### Build options

Execute the commands below to build from the source.

1. To build all packages:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

2. To run the tests in all packages:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean test
   ```

3. To build without the tests:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -x test
   ```

4. To build only one specific package:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean :procurement-ballerina:<module_name>:build
   ```

   | Module Name                | Connector                                        |
   |----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
   | api_inforecord_process_srv | ballerinax/sap.s4hana.api_inforecord_process_srv |

5. To run tests against a live server, add a `tests/Config.toml` file to the package with the live server details
   and run the tests (`Config.toml` files are ignored by Git):

   ```toml
   isTestOnLiveServer = true
   hostname = "<unique id>-api.s4hana.cloud.sap"
   username = "<communication user>"
   password = "<password>"
   ```

   **Note**: Tests are run against the mock server by default.

6. To debug packages with a remote debugger:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -Pdebug=<port>
   ```

7. To debug with the Ballerina language:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -PbalJavaDebug=<port>
   ```

8. Publish the generated artifacts to the local Ballerina Central repository:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -PpublishToLocalCentral=true
   ```
